@channel Hey everyone, a clarification for the tddbin assignments:

Make sure to take a screenshot of the whole page not just the passing tests!

If we've already submitted, do we need to redo those and resubmit?

Mack [9:22 AM]
@Anna Ridenour (they/them) all good just going forward.

Can instructors please use standard naming conventions for assignments? e.g., when referencing them in discussion and slack please call them by what they’re titled in Canvas. “tddbin” isn’t an assignment, but “ES6 let and const” is.
